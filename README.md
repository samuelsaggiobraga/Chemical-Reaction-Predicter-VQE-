# Quantum Chemistry Reaction Predictor

PROJECT ON HOLD


Important notes
* I'll be keeping the website interface and training data because that was actually pretty decent
* Moving forward, gemini is really bad for what this project is trying to accomplish, on the return of this (likely December) I'll go into a pure ML approach, and focus on simple reactions (harder reactions requires computing power I don't possess)
* MATLAB is similarly really bad, it gives good data but the limitation on processing speeds is horrible for even simple reactions and qubit restrictions makes the data near useless for any real applications
* I will also need to eventually increase the size of the training data
* The overall goal of this project on a small scale is to eventually provide stronger intuition for predicting smaller reactions (examine the ML workings)
